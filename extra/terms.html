Proper Give exists to share educational content about finance, savings, investing, and personal money management. Everything published here is for informational purposes only and should never be taken as financial or legal advice.

<p>You are responsible for how you use the information found here. The articles, examples, and opinions shared are based on general experience and publicly available knowledge, not your specific financial situation. We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any content, though we aim to maintain it current and reliable. Markets change constantly, and information may become outdated at any moment. By using this website, you accept that we cannot be held responsible for any losses or damages that may occur as a result of decisions based on the material provided.

<p>You agree to use Proper Give lawfully and respectfully. You may not post, upload, or distribute any material that is illegal, abusive, defamatory, fraudulent, or harmful. Attempting to interfere with the functionality of the site, upload malicious code, or gain unauthorized access to our systems is strictly prohibited. You may not reproduce, copy, republish, or distribute any content from Proper Give for commercial purposes without explicit written permission. All text, layout, design, and images on the site are protected by copyright and intellectual-property laws.

<p>Proper Give owns the rights to its content unless stated otherwise. You may share short excerpts or links for personal or educational use, provided that credit is given and that such sharing does not misrepresent our work or harm our reputation. Using our material for resale, mass reproduction, or any commercial purpose is not permitted. If you believe we have unintentionally used your copyrighted material, contact us through the Contact page and we will address it promptly.

<p>This website may contain links to external sites or references to third-party services. These are provided for convenience and informational purposes only. We do not control or endorse external content, nor do we take responsibility for their accuracy or privacy practices. Visiting those websites is entirely at your own risk. Proper Give may include advertisements through Google AdSense or other networks. These networks may use cookies to deliver relevant ads based on your browsing behavior. For details on how data is collected and used, you can refer to our Privacy Policy.

<p>From time to time, Proper Give may publish sponsored articles, affiliate links, or product recommendations. We only promote partners or services that we believe are useful or aligned with our editorial standards. However, readers should always perform their own due diligence before making any purchase or investment. We do not guarantee or take liability for third-party offers, transactions, or services. Transparency is a core value of this site, and any paid content will always be disclosed.

<p>Proper Give does not promise uninterrupted or error-free access to its website. Technical issues, maintenance, or updates may cause temporary interruptions. The site and its content are provided “as is” without any warranties, express or implied, regarding availability, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose. We make no guarantees that the website or its servers are free from viruses or harmful components. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your devices and security settings are adequate before accessing our pages.

<p>Under no circumstances shall Proper Give, its contributors, or partners be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages that result from your use of or inability to use the site. This includes but is not limited to loss of profits, data, reputation, or business opportunities. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with any portion of the website is to stop using it. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitation of liability, so portions of this clause may not apply to you.

<p>If the site allows you to comment or submit feedback, you must ensure that your contributions are respectful and lawful. You remain the owner of your submitted content but grant Proper Give a non-exclusive right to display and use it on the website. We reserve the right to moderate, edit, or remove any comment at our discretion. Harassment, spam, self-promotion, or offensive language will not be tolerated.

<p>Proper Give may, at any time and without notice, modify or discontinue any part of its services, including articles, design, or access features. We may also change these Terms when necessary to reflect updates in operations, legal requirements, or site improvements. The most recent version will always be published on this page, and continued use of the website after updates means you accept the revised terms.

<p>Advertising on Proper Give may be managed through Google AdSense or similar platforms. These services use automated technology to display ads based on visitor interests and browsing habits. While ads help support the website, we do not control which advertisements appear, nor do we endorse the products or services they promote. Readers are encouraged to verify the reliability of any advertised brand before engaging with it. You can control how Google uses cookies for ad personalization by visiting your Ad Settings.

<p>We take reasonable steps to maintain the security and integrity of the site, but you acknowledge that no system can be completely secure. Submitting personal data through contact forms or email is done at your own risk. We will not share or sell personal information to third parties except where required by law or when necessary to operate the website.

<p>These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in our operating jurisdiction. Any disputes arising out of or related to the use of Proper Give shall be resolved through competent local courts. If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, that provision shall be interpreted to reflect the original intent as closely as possible, while all remaining clauses continue in effect.

<p>By using this website, you agree to indemnify and hold Proper Give, its owners, editors, and affiliates harmless from any claims, liabilities, or expenses arising from your use of the site, your breach of these Terms, or your violation of any rights of others. This includes reasonable attorney fees and costs associated with defending such claims.

<p>We reserve the right to terminate or restrict access to the website for any user who violates these Terms or engages in activity that disrupts or harms Proper Give or its community. Termination may occur without prior notice. Provisions regarding intellectual property, liability, disclaimers, and governing law will survive any termination.

<p>Proper Give may communicate updates, newsletters, or service notices by email to users who subscribe voluntarily. You may opt out of these communications at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions included in our emails.

<p>Our mission is to share reliable financial education in a simple, respectful, and transparent way. Everything we publish is created with the intention to help readers grow their understanding of money and decision-making. However, we cannot promise financial success or personal outcomes. Responsibility for decisions made based on our content remains entirely with the user.
