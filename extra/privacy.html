<p>At Proper Give, accessible at https://proper-give.vercel.app
, we respect the privacy of our visitors and are committed to protecting any personal information that you choose to share with us. This Privacy Policy explains in plain terms how we collect, use, and protect your data when you visit our website, interact with our pages, or engage with any of our content and services. By continuing to use this site, you agree to the terms outlined below.

<p>Proper Give is designed to provide educational and informative content about finance, saving, and personal development. While we focus on transparency and simplicity, our operation involves collecting certain information to maintain the site, improve user experience, and deliver relevant advertising through networks such as Google AdSense. We handle all such data responsibly and in compliance with privacy standards.

<p>When you visit Proper Give, some information is collected automatically. This may include your browser type, device model, IP address, approximate location, time of access, pages visited, and referring URLs. This information helps us analyze site traffic, understand reader preferences, and identify ways to enhance the website. These details do not personally identify you; they are gathered for statistical and technical purposes to improve performance and user experience.

<p>We may also collect personal information if you choose to provide it voluntarily. This typically happens when you fill out a contact form, leave a comment, or subscribe to a newsletter. The personal information you provide, such as your name and email address, is used solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry, delivering requested updates, or improving our services. We will never sell, rent, or share this data with unaffiliated third parties.

<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your device when you access a website. Proper Give uses cookies to remember your preferences, analyze website activity, and display relevant advertising. Cookies allow us to tailor content and track engagement metrics such as time on page, number of visitors, and popular articles. By using this site, you consent to the use of cookies as described in this policy. You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings at any time, but doing so may affect how certain features of the site function.

<p>Proper Give also uses third-party cookies through services like Google AdSense, Google Analytics, and possibly other advertising or analytic networks. These services may collect data independently from us, including information about your browsing activity across different websites, in order to provide relevant ads and performance insights. Google’s use of advertising cookies enables it and its partners to serve ads to users based on their visit to Proper Give and other sites. Users can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google’s Ad Settings or through the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page.

<p>We use the data collected to improve website functionality, personalize your experience, measure content performance, and serve advertisements that align with your interests. The information also helps us maintain security and prevent misuse of the website. We do not use your personal data for any purpose other than those described in this policy, and we take appropriate measures to ensure it remains secure.

<p>Proper Give stores collected information only as long as necessary to fulfill its intended purpose. We retain contact form submissions and newsletter sign-up information for as long as they are active or until a deletion request is made. You may contact us at any time to request that we delete your personal data from our systems.

<p>While we take security seriously, no method of data transmission or electronic storage can be guaranteed completely secure. We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, by using this site, you acknowledge that transmitting information over the internet always carries some degree of risk.

<p>If you comment on blog posts or submit any content publicly, your name or chosen username may appear alongside your comment. These comments are publicly visible to other visitors. We are not responsible for how third parties may use any information that you choose to share publicly in such areas. For your safety, you should never post personal details such as phone numbers, addresses, or financial information in public sections of the website.

<p>Proper Give may contain links to other websites or embedded content from external platforms such as YouTube or social media. These sites may collect data through their own tracking technologies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of external websites. Once you leave Proper Give, your interaction with other sites is governed by their respective privacy policies.

<p>Advertising on Proper Give may come from third-party ad networks. These networks may use cookies, web beacons, or other tracking technologies to measure ad effectiveness and deliver relevant promotions. While these ads help us keep the site free and operational, we do not control what ads appear, nor the data practices of advertisers. We advise users to review the privacy policies of any advertised companies before engaging with them.

<p>In some cases, we may collaborate with partners, affiliates, or analytics providers to study aggregated traffic trends and improve website experience. These partners may access limited, anonymized data strictly for analysis and never for personal profiling. Any collaboration follows privacy and data-protection standards consistent with this policy.

<p>If you are a visitor from the European Union or other regions with privacy laws requiring consent, you have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. You may also request that we stop processing your data or restrict its use. To make such a request, you can reach us through our Contact page, and we will handle it in accordance with applicable regulations.

<p>We do not knowingly collect or store personal information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that such information has been submitted inadvertently, we will delete it promptly. Parents or guardians who believe that a child has provided personal information are encouraged to contact us so that we can take the necessary steps to remove it.

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect changes in our practices, technology, or legal requirements. When we make significant updates, we will revise the date at the top of this page to indicate the change. Continued use of Proper Give after a revision constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. Users are encouraged to review this page periodically to stay informed about how their data is handled.

<p>If Proper Give undergoes organizational changes, such as a transfer of ownership or a merger, user data may be transferred to the new entity to ensure continuity of service. In such cases, the same privacy commitments will continue to apply unless a new policy is published.

<p>We are committed to maintaining transparency about how we use data. The limited information we collect is used solely to improve the reader’s experience, maintain site operations, and support the financial sustainability of our platform through advertising. We believe that protecting user privacy and maintaining a clear boundary between editorial content and advertising integrity is essential for long-term trust.

<p>Proper Give does not engage in spam or unsolicited communication. If you receive an email from us, it is because you opted in to receive it. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link at the bottom of our emails or by contacting us directly. We process unsubscribe requests promptly.

<p>We may retain anonymous logs and usage statistics indefinitely for research and improvement purposes. These records contain no personally identifying information and are used only to help us analyze traffic patterns and improve content quality.

<p>Our Privacy Policy is written in clear language to help readers understand what happens with their data. We encourage everyone who uses the site to read this document carefully before continuing to use any of its features. By remaining on the site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms outlined here.

<p>If you have questions, concerns, or complaints about how Proper Give handles personal information, or if you wish to exercise your data rights, you can contact us via the Contact page. We respond to privacy-related inquiries as quickly as possible and treat them with high priority.

<p>Proper Give thanks you for trusting our content and our integrity. We take privacy seriously and believe that visitors have the right to know what happens to their information. Our objective is not only to comply with privacy laws but also to maintain a transparent and respectful relationship with every reader.
