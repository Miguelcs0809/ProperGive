        <h2>1. Define Your Retirement Vision</h2>
        <p>Retirement planning starts with clarity. What does your ideal life look like after work? Traveling, volunteering, or simply having peace of mind? Your vision determines how much you’ll need and what lifestyle you’re preparing for. The clearer your goals, the easier it is to create a financial roadmap that supports them.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>2. Estimate Your Future Expenses</h2>
        <p>Analyze your current spending and adjust for your retirement goals. Consider housing, healthcare, travel, and inflation. Many underestimate long-term costs, leading to stress later. Building in safety margins ensures you maintain comfort without worry. Overestimate needs rather than risk falling short.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>3. Start Investing Early and Consistently</h2>
        <p>Time is your greatest ally. Begin investing as soon as possible, even with small amounts. Use retirement accounts like IRAs, 401(k)s, or mutual funds. Compounding turns steady contributions into exponential growth. The earlier you start, the less you’ll need to invest overall to reach the same goal.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>4. Maximize Employer Contributions</h2>
        <p>If your employer offers a retirement plan with matching contributions, contribute at least enough to receive the full match. It’s essentially free money that accelerates your savings. Many people miss out simply by neglecting this advantage — don’t be one of them.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/diversify.jpg" alt="Diversify investments"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>5. Diversify Your Investments</h2>
        <p>A balanced portfolio reduces risk and smooths performance. Combine stocks for growth, bonds for stability, and cash reserves for flexibility. As retirement nears, shift toward safer investments to protect against market volatility. Diversification ensures your future doesn’t rely on one fragile source.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/inflation.jpg" alt="Account for inflation"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>6. Plan for Inflation</h2>
        <p>Inflation erodes purchasing power over time. If your savings grow slower than inflation, your future income effectively shrinks. Choose investments that outpace inflation, such as equities or inflation-protected securities. Planning for this now ensures your money maintains real value decades later.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/debtplan.jpg" alt="Eliminate debt"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>7. Eliminate Debt Before Retirement</h2>
        <p>Entering retirement debt-free reduces stress and expenses. Focus on paying off credit cards, personal loans, and your mortgage early. Fewer obligations mean lower required income and greater flexibility with your retirement funds. Freedom from debt equals peace of mind.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/healthcare.jpg" alt="Healthcare planning"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>8. Prepare for Healthcare Costs</h2>
        <p>Healthcare can become one of the largest retirement expenses. Research insurance options, health savings accounts (HSAs), and supplemental plans early. Building dedicated healthcare savings now avoids financial strain later when medical needs increase.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/incomestreams.jpg" alt="Income streams"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>9. Create Multiple Income Streams</h2>
        <p>Relying solely on one source, like a pension or savings account, can be risky. Supplement with rental income, part-time consulting, or dividend investments. Multiple income streams create resilience and flexibility — key traits for long-term financial security.</p>

        <h2>10. Plan Your Legacy</h2>
        <p>Retirement planning doesn’t end with you. Create a will, update beneficiaries, and consider trusts or charitable giving. Leaving a legacy ensures your wealth continues to support family and causes that matter most. True financial success includes impact beyond your lifetime.</p>
