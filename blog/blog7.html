    <p class="intro">
      Compound interest is the quiet force behind wealth creation. It rewards patience, consistency, and discipline. Here’s how it works and how to make it work for you.

        <h2>1. What Is Compound Interest?</h2>
        <p>Compound interest means earning interest on your interest. When you save or invest, the money grows not just from your initial deposit but from the earnings it generates. Over time, that cycle accelerates—the longer it compounds, the faster it grows. Unlike linear growth, compounding follows exponential math. It’s why starting early matters far more than investing huge sums later.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>2. The Time Value of Money</h2>
        <p>Money today is worth more than the same amount tomorrow because it can be invested and earn returns. The earlier you begin saving, the more time your money has to multiply. Waiting even a few years can mean losing decades of growth. Time, not timing, is the most powerful variable in wealth creation.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>3. Start Small, Start Now</h2>
        <p>Many delay investing, thinking they need large sums to begin. In reality, small consistent contributions matter more. A few dollars invested monthly can become thousands over years. Consistency beats intensity—every early dollar has decades to grow, while late investments must work harder to catch up.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>4. Reinvest Your Returns</h2>
        <p>Withdrawing interest breaks the compounding cycle. To maximize growth, reinvest earnings automatically. Whether in dividends, savings interest, or investment gains, reinvestment multiplies results. The goal is to let your money keep working instead of interrupting its progress for short-term gratification.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>5. Beat Inflation with Growth</h2>
        <p>Inflation silently reduces purchasing power. Keeping cash idle in low-yield accounts means losing value every year. Compounding through stocks, bonds, or index funds helps your money grow faster than inflation, preserving and increasing real wealth over time.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/discipline.jpg" alt="Financial discipline"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>6. Stay Disciplined Through Market Fluctuations</h2>
        <p>Markets rise and fall, but compounding rewards patience. Selling during downturns locks in losses and resets growth. Staying invested allows recovery and continuous compounding. Time in the market beats timing the market—every missed year weakens long-term gains.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/consistency.jpg" alt="Consistency in investing"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>7. Automate Contributions</h2>
        <p>Automation removes the temptation to skip investing. Set automatic transfers from checking to investment accounts monthly. Consistency ensures your money compounds without relying on motivation. Systems build wealth while emotion destroys it.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/patience.jpg" alt="Patience with money"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>8. Patience Is a Financial Superpower</h2>
        <p>Compounding feels slow at first, then suddenly fast. Early years may seem unrewarding, but patience transforms small beginnings into large results. The final stage of compounding delivers exponential growth—if you stay long enough to see it.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>9. Understand the Reverse: Compound Debt</h2>
        <p>Compounding also works against you in debt. Interest on unpaid balances grows exponentially, trapping many in endless repayment. The same math that builds wealth can destroy it when used carelessly. Pay high-interest debt first to stop negative compounding before focusing on investments.</p>

        <h2>10. Use Compounding to Build Generational Wealth</h2>
        <p>Wealth multiplies when passed through time and generations. Teaching children about compound growth ensures family assets expand instead of erode. The earlier each generation begins, the more freedom and opportunity they inherit. Compounding is more than finance—it’s legacy.</p>

      <h2>The Quiet Force That Builds Fortunes</h2>
      <p>Compounding doesn’t rely on luck—it relies on time, patience, and consistency. The earlier you begin and the longer you persist, the more your money works while you rest. That’s how ordinary savers become extraordinary investors.</p>
