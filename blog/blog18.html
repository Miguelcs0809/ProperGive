    <p class="intro">
      Wealth isn’t about how much you earn—it’s about what you do with what you have. Even with modest income, you can create long-term stability and growth. Here’s how to start right now.

        <h2>1. Start with the Right Mindset</h2>
        <p>Building wealth begins mentally, not financially. Stop thinking, “I can’t save because I don’t make enough.” Wealthy habits matter more than income size. Focus on control—spend less than you earn, invest the difference, and repeat consistently. The right mindset turns limitation into opportunity.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>2. Create a Budget You’ll Actually Follow</h2>
        <p>Budgeting on a low income is about clarity, not deprivation. Track every expense and categorize spending. Identify essentials, eliminate waste, and allocate a small percentage—no matter how small—to savings. Every dollar needs a job. Discipline turns small income into big impact over time.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>3. Save Automatically</h2>
        <p>Manual saving fails because it relies on willpower. Set up an automatic transfer to a savings account right after payday. Even $10 per week compounds. Automation creates consistency, and consistency creates wealth. Small, steady deposits beat sporadic big ones every time.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/investsmall.jpg" alt="Invest small"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>4. Invest Small Amounts Regularly</h2>
        <p>Investing isn’t just for the rich. Apps and index funds let you start with a few dollars. Use automatic contributions to keep the habit alive. The earlier you begin, the longer your money compounds. Don’t wait for “extra cash”—build wealth with what you have right now.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>5. Develop a Side Income Stream</h2>
        <p>When income is tight, growth comes from creativity. Start freelancing, selling services, or learning an online skill. Side income doesn’t just add money—it adds options. Reinvest those extra dollars into savings or assets instead of lifestyle upgrades. That’s how the wealth gap closes over time.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>6. Avoid High-Interest Debt</h2>
        <p>Debt drains limited income faster than anything else. Avoid payday loans and high-interest credit cards. If you already owe, focus on repayment using the snowball or avalanche method. Becoming debt-free increases your available income instantly—it’s like giving yourself a raise without changing jobs.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>7. Focus on Skill Growth</h2>
        <p>The best investment you can make on a low income is in yourself. Learn valuable, high-demand skills—writing, coding, sales, or design. Free online resources can transform your earning potential. Every new skill learned compounds like money—it pays you for life.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>8. Live Frugally, Not Miserably</h2>
        <p>Frugality is freedom, not punishment. Buy what adds long-term value and skip what doesn’t. Shop secondhand, cook at home, and compare prices. Small daily savings add up faster than most people realize. Simplicity now builds comfort later.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>9. Stay Consistent, Even When It’s Slow</h2>
        <p>Progress on a low income takes time—but every step matters. Stick to your budget, save regularly, and keep learning. The compound effect turns persistence into prosperity. You don’t have to move fast—just don’t stop.</p>

        <h2>10. Redefine What Wealth Means</h2>
        <p>Wealth isn’t just money—it’s control, freedom, and security. Even if your income is modest, financial discipline and education can create true wealth. Focus on independence, not comparison. Real success is living on your terms, not someone else’s timeline.</p>
