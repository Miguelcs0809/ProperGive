    <p class="intro">
      Investing is the bridge between earning money and building wealth. It’s not about luck—it’s about patience, discipline, and informed decisions. Here’s how to start investing the smart way.

        <h2>1. Understand Why You’re Investing</h2>
        <p>Investing without purpose is gambling. Clarify what you’re investing for—retirement, buying a home, financial freedom, or education. Your goals determine your risk tolerance, timeline, and asset choices. Investing is a tool for independence, not entertainment. Every dollar should serve a future objective, not an impulse.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>2. Know the Relationship Between Risk and Reward</h2>
        <p>Higher returns come with higher risks. The stock market grows wealth but fluctuates. Bonds are steadier but slower. Real estate offers security but needs maintenance. Diversification spreads risk and smooths performance. Never invest in something you don’t understand—clarity is more valuable than hype.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>3. Start Early and Let Time Work for You</h2>
        <p>Time multiplies money through compounding. The earlier you invest, the more growth accelerates. Even small amounts invested consistently can outperform large sums started late. The market rewards patience, not perfection. Start with what you have and build consistency before worrying about size.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>4. Diversify Your Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Diversification protects against volatility. Spread investments across sectors, asset types, and geographies. If one area dips, others may rise. A balanced portfolio might include stocks, bonds, real estate, and ETFs. The goal isn’t to chase maximum returns—it’s to survive every market condition.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>5. Choose a Long-Term Strategy</h2>
        <p>Short-term trading feels exciting but rarely succeeds consistently. Focus on a buy-and-hold strategy. Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs that track the market. Long-term investors benefit from growth and reduced stress. The market always rewards patience more than prediction.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/costs.jpg" alt="Investment costs"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>6. Keep Costs Low</h2>
        <p>Fees quietly erode profits. A 1% annual management fee may sound small, but it can consume tens of thousands over decades. Favor low-cost index funds and automated investment platforms. Every dollar saved in fees compounds into future earnings. In investing, controlling costs equals increasing returns.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/emotions.jpg" alt="Control emotions"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>7. Don’t Let Emotions Drive Decisions</h2>
        <p>Fear and greed are the investor’s worst enemies. When markets drop, many sell out of panic; when they rise, they chase hype. Both destroy returns. Stay disciplined. Stick to your plan regardless of market mood. Emotional control is a skill more valuable than market timing.</p>

      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/reviewportfolio.jpg" alt="Review portfolio"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>8. Review and Rebalance Regularly</h2>
        <p>Your portfolio shifts as markets move. Rebalancing brings it back to your desired risk level. If stocks outperform, sell a little to buy underperforming assets. This forces you to “buy low, sell high” systematically. A yearly review keeps your plan aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>9. Avoid Using Debt to Invest</h2>
        <p>Borrowing to invest magnifies both gains and losses. Unless you’re highly experienced, avoid leverage. Debt adds risk that can destroy years of progress in one downturn. It’s better to build wealth steadily than gamble with borrowed money. Real success is sustainable, not explosive.</p>

      <div class="text">
        <h2>10. Be Patient—Wealth Takes Time</h2>
        <p>Most millionaires weren’t made overnight. Markets move in cycles. Some years will test your patience, others will reward it. Stay consistent through both. Investing isn’t about timing peaks; it’s about time spent in the market. Wealth isn’t built by guessing—it’s built by waiting.</p>
      </div>

    <section class="feature reveal highlight">
      <h2>Investing Is About Behavior, Not Genius</h2>
      <p>The smartest investors aren’t the most analytical—they’re the most disciplined. Success comes from consistent, emotion-free decisions repeated for years. The market rewards those who stay calm while others panic.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="feature reveal">
      <h2>Start Simple, Learn Continuously</h2>
      <p>Don’t wait for perfect knowledge to begin. Start small, learn as you go, and refine your approach. The best investors are students for life, not experts for a season.</p>
