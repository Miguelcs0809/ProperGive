    <h1 class="page-title">How to Build Credit and Maintain a Strong Credit Score</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      Your credit score shapes your financial opportunities. Whether you're applying for a loan, renting an apartment, or starting a business, credit reputation matters. Here's a complete guide to building and protecting it.

  <main class="content">

    <!-- SECTION 1 -->
    <section class="section reveal light">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/creditreport.jpg" alt="Checking credit report"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>1. Understand How Credit Works</h2>
        <p>Credit is a record of trust. Lenders measure how reliably you borrow and repay money. Your credit score summarizes this behavior in a number ranging from 300 to 850. Understanding factors like payment history, credit utilization, and account age gives you control over that number. Knowledge is the first step toward responsible borrowing.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 2 -->
    <section class="section reveal dark">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/payontime.jpg" alt="Paying bills on time"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>2. Pay All Bills on Time</h2>
        <p>Payment history is the most important credit factor. Even one late payment can hurt your score for months. Use reminders, automatic payments, or budgeting apps to ensure consistency. Reliability builds trust faster than any credit hack ever could.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->
    <section class="section reveal light">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/creditutilization.jpg" alt="Credit utilization"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>3. Keep Credit Utilization Low</h2>
        <p>Using too much of your available credit signals risk to lenders. Aim to use under 30% of your total limit, and under 10% for the best scores. Paying balances before the statement date keeps utilization low and interest costs smaller.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <section class="section reveal dark">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/securedcard.jpg" alt="Secured credit card"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>4. Start with a Secured Credit Card</h2>
        <p>If you have no credit history, secured cards are an entry point. You deposit a small amount as collateral, then use the card normally. After several months of on-time payments, your activity is reported to credit bureaus and builds your record.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 5 -->
    <section class="section reveal light">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/creditmix.jpg" alt="Credit mix"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>5. Maintain a Healthy Credit Mix</h2>
        <p>Credit scoring models reward variety. A mix of credit cards, installment loans, and other accounts shows lenders you can manage different obligations responsibly. Don’t open unnecessary accounts, but use a few types strategically.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 6 -->
    <section class="section reveal dark">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/checkreport.jpg" alt="Checking report for errors"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>6. Review Your Credit Reports Regularly</h2>
        <p>You’re entitled to a free annual report from each major bureau. Review them for errors or fraudulent accounts. Dispute any inaccuracy immediately—credit mistakes can silently lower your score and cost you real money.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 7 -->
    <section class="section reveal light">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/newaccounts.jpg" alt="Applying for new accounts carefully"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>7. Limit New Credit Applications</h2>
        <p>Each time you apply for new credit, a hard inquiry slightly reduces your score. Applying for too many accounts at once makes lenders cautious. Focus on long-term relationships with existing institutions instead of chasing multiple cards.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 8 -->
    <section class="section reveal dark">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/agedaccounts.jpg" alt="Keeping old accounts open"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>8. Keep Old Accounts Open</h2>
        <p>The length of your credit history contributes about 15% of your score. Older accounts strengthen it by showing long-term stability. Unless an account has high fees or issues, keep it open to preserve your average account age.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 9 -->
    <section class="section reveal light">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/debtplan.jpg" alt="Debt management plan"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>9. Manage Debt Strategically</h2>
        <p>If debt becomes overwhelming, create a structured plan. The avalanche method prioritizes high-interest balances; the snowball method targets small debts first for motivation. Either approach works if you stay consistent and stop borrowing unnecessarily.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 10 -->
    <section class="section reveal dark">
      <div class="image"><img src="../photo/patience.jpg" alt="Patience in credit building"></div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>10. Be Patient and Consistent</h2>
        <p>Building excellent credit takes time. Scores rise gradually as positive habits repeat. Focus on behavior, not quick fixes. Credit is earned through reliability, and that consistency is what lenders value most.</p>
      </div>

    <!-- FEATURE SECTIONS -->
    <section class="feature reveal highlight">
      <h2>The Long-Term Benefits of Good Credit</h2>
      <p>Strong credit saves money. It lowers interest rates, improves approval odds, and can even influence job or rental opportunities. Treat credit as an asset—it expands your options and builds lifelong financial resilience.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="feature reveal">
      <h2>Common Credit Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <p>Closing old cards too quickly, maxing out balances, or missing small payments are silent score killers. Consistency and awareness matter more than complex tricks. Protect your progress by making deliberate, informed decisions.</p>
